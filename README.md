### Basic Information
Hello,
This is the solution of UVA in python 3 language
If you are learning about competitive programming,
feel free to learn from this github.
But remember, **do not copy and paste** the solution. Because it will not enhance your knowledge at all!.


Then, you can also visit my website to find the explanation about the code.
Enjoy the process.


(not really up to date explanation on website but I will try to finish the post as soon as the possible)


### Intention
Usually people solve competitive programming (UVA) problem in C/C++ or Java language.
I did finish most of concept and some UVA question in C++ in uni before.


But now, Since I mainly use Python as my main language. 
I am going to do it again using python.
At first I just want to revisit, but I'll also upload it here so we can learn together


Enjoy.
